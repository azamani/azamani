### 🚀 What I’m Working On:
- Currently interning in a small team where I’m learning and contributing to projects that aim to build quant-capable solutions for finance.
- Exploring how engineering principles can be applied to coding workflows and automations.

---

### 💡 What Excites Me:
- I love **digging into design calculations**, understanding governing formulas, and ensuring projects run smoothly by considering all possible factors and risks.
- I’m intrigued by the **intersection of engineering, data science**, and how they can solve real-world problems.
- **Collaboration** is key. Though I work best individually, I’m learning how to bring out the best in team efforts.

### 🔧 Technologies & Tools I Use:
- Mechanical Design: **NX**, **Inventor**
- Coding: **Python**, **Jupyterlab
- Passionate about **project management** and the technical depth behind every decision.

---

### 🌱 What I’m Learning:
- **Advanced Python programming** (always improving and learning to write better code).
- Exploring **quantitative finance** and **API-based data analysis**.

---

### ✨ My Interests:
- Designing solutions that blend **engineering** with **software development**.
- Exploring how mechanical design workflows can benefit from automation and data-driven insights.
- Continuously learning how to improve my focus and productivity—finding the balance between work and mental well-being.
